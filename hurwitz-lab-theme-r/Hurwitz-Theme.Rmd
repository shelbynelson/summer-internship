```

### Hurwitz Lab Colors
The following variable, hurwitz_colors, holds the Hurwitz Lab colors. The first eleven colors follow the Hurwitz Lab theme and the last five are random colors in case there is more keys in the data.

```{r}

hurwitz_colors <- c("#018d97", "#f5811f", "gold", "#61cddc", "#6a6a6a", "tomato4", "tan", "darkslategray1", "gray20", "gray80", "burlywood4", "red", "yellow", "darkgreen", "blue", "purple")



```



## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
